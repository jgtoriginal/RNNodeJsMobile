## Example

To run the example project, clone the repo, and run `pod install` from the Example directory first.

## Requirements

## Installation

RNNodeJsMobile is not yet available through [CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org). 
To install it, you will need first to install `nodejs-mobile-react-native` npm package first.

Since the main project hasn't got a `podspec` file yet, you will need to install from a specific fork.

`npm install npm install https://github.com/jgtoriginal/nodejs-mobile-react-native/tarball/podspec`

And then point your podfile to the `podspec` within that package, by adding the following line to your `Podfile`

`pod 'RNNodeJsMobile', :podspec => '../node_modules/nodejs-mobile-react-native/RNNodeJsMobile.podspec'`

Finally install your pods

`pod install`

#### Enjoy!
